# aoc2025

Each day is a function that outputs part 1 followed by part 2.
The functions are named dn where n is the day.
Each function takes the input file as a string, for example running day one would look like `d1 '1.in'`.
For day 5 split the input into two files for the two sections of the input.

To run the code, either download the dws file and run `)load aoc` to load the workspace that includes all of the provided functions, or just copy paste the function you want.
